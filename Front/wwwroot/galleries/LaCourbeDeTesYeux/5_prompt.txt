romantic scenery of a man and woman gazing into each other's eyes, evening, in a dimly lit room, simple yet intimate, every detail intimate and loving, all painted in soft colors, nostalgic, 1920s era, oil painting, subdued lighting, a touch of innocence and young love, eyes that speak volumes, rich textures and intricate details.
