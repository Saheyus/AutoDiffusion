Tottenham Court Road at dawn with Sherlock Holmes character and another man, victorian-era cobblestone pavement, gas-lamp lit, one man unsteadily walking and carrying a goose on his shoulder, exchanging an old hat with the other, gritty realism, cool early morning colors, foggy atmosphere, Victorian London setting, noir-style, high contrast, side-angle view, gas-light illumination.
